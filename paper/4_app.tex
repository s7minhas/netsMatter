\section{Re-estimation with AME}
 
\subsection{Design}

We choose five prominent studies from the broad field of international relations and international political economy that utilize relational data \citep{reiter:stam:2003, mcdonald:2004,  rose:2004, weeks:2012, gibler:2017}. These studies are recent and have been cited over 100 times. Each of these pieces was published in a prominent journal and is well-known in the literature. Each used the standard approach in political science, which is to employ some form of a general linearized regression that ignores dyadic interdependencies, except as they may reveal themselves in included variables. Also part of the gold standard is a post estimation cleanup thought to be a palliative, and each of these studies adjust the posterior standard errors in an attempt to account for the clustering of observations.

\begin{table}

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We obtained the data for each of these studies from their replication archives and replicated the main results of each of the articles.\footnote{Without exception this was straightforward to accomplish, thanks to an increasing norm in the social sciences of open data sharing.} We also examine each of the models using the AME framework described above.  Our goal is to ascertain whether the ignored interdependencies -- the non-iid structure of the relational data -- would result in different model estimates when they were addressed in an AME framework, and more importantly to see if there were substantive opportunities that were presented with the dynamic factor approach.  
Finally, in each study we assess whether there is any new substantive finding that emerges or indeed if any disappear once the interdependencies in the data are modeled.

The broader goal, beyond introducing the use of the AME framework in an applied setting, is to examine the extent to which interdependencies within typical dyadic data make much difference in what we have learned about international relations from recent empirical studies that use a framework that ignores dependencies.  Based in part our our results as well as the statistical and mathematical characteristics of the AME framework, we believe that it does. The dynamic latent factor model provides a step forward in the modeling of international relations.

Given current practices, most scholars have a single variable in a complicated empirical model that they look at for evaluating the validity of their empirically estimated models.  Whether putative control variables, for example, are precisely estimated is less important. Generally, interpretations focus on a small set of independent variables.  In the study by Reiter and Stam (2003) the main question is to determine in mixed dyads -- consisting of a democratic country and country ruled by a personalist dictatorship -- whether it is the democratic country or the personalist country that is associated with a greater likelihood that the dyad is in a dispute.  In a regression including fourteen coefficients, they focus on whether the variables that capture whether the initiator is a democratic country are statistically significant.\footnote{In particular, the variables \texttt{Pers/Democ} and \texttt{Democ/Pers} in Model 3, in Table 1, page 335.} In our evaluation we focus on the same question in the re-examination of the Reiter and Stam study to determine whether the model replicates when re-estimated within the AME framework. Each of the other four studies also has a crucial finding that we hone in on to further draw into focus the potential differences brought about by utilizing an AME estimation procedure.  In Table~\ref{tab:modelFindingSumm}, we present the overall results; the term \textit{does not replicate} indicates only that the sign and/or significance of the putatively crucial finding in the original study is not also found in the AME estimation.

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{Here we provide a brief summary of the key variable in each of the five replications and a note about whether or not the finding is replicated when using our network based approach. Cases in which the substantive finding is not replicated are highlighted in bold.}

\end{table}

In addition, we also examine the predictions made with each approach using an out-of-sample cross validation strategy. By accounting for exogenous and network dependent patterns that give rise to conflict systems we are able to better account for the data generating process underlying relational data structures. To show that this is the case, we examine whether our approach achieves better predictive performance in an out-of-sample context than traditional dyadic models. To evaluate our model, we randomly divide the $\binom n 2 \times T$ data values into $k=30$ sets, letting $s_{ij,t}$ be the set to which pair $ij,t$ is assigned. Then for each $s \in \{1,\ldots,k\}$, we:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item estimate model parameters with $\{y_{ij,t}: s_{ij,t} \neq s\}$, the data not in set $s$,
	\item and predict $\{\hat{y}_{ij,t}: s_{ij,t} = s\}$ from these estimated parameters. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The result of this procedure is a set of sociomatrices $\bm \hat Y$, in which each entry $\hat y_{ij,t}$ is a predicted value obtained from using a subset of the data that does not include $y_{ij,t}$. 

We set a number of benchmarks for comparison. First, we compare the AME model to a GLM model (that used in the original study) using the same covariates to show the effect of accounting for network dependencies on predicting conflict. We supplement this with an alternative GLM that includes not just these covariates, but also a lagged dependent variable and a lagged reciprocity term. The lagged dependent variable is the equivalent of saying that conflict and peace are relatively likely to persist between dyads, while the inclusion of a lagged reciprocity term in a GLM framework is a simple way to account for retaliatory strikes.

We utilize three performance criteria to compare the models: Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves, Precision Recall (PR) curves, and separation plots. ROC curves look at the trade-off between true positive rates and false positive rates at different thresholds of classification. An issue with an ROC Curve when looking at conflict, is that it is relatively rare at the dyadic level: in most years only 3\% of possible dyads are in conflict with one another. If peace is common, even a poor model will have a very low False Positive Rate. The ROC curves are best for balanced samples with as many events as non-events. To better assess which models predict the presence of conflict, not just its absence, we look at PR Curves. These examine the trade-offs between the percentage of conflicts a model predicts, and the percentage of predicted conflicts which occur. Lastly, we examine separation plots \citep{greenhill:etal:2011}. These provide an intuitive visualization of the accuracy of our predictions by juxtaposing a line showing the predicted probability of conflict with whether conflict actually occurs for all cases (where the cases are sorted by the predicted probability and then colored to indicate the outcome). Here a perfect model would have all cases where conflict actually exists on the right with a predicted probability of $1$, and would predict $0$ in all other cases. All of the models' performance out of sample by these metrics are displayed in figure \ref{fig:roc_ame}. The AME model with covariates is the best performing model out of sample in all cases. This model outperforms each of the GLM variants by a notable margin.

\subsection{Replication of Reiter \& Stam (2003)}

\citet{reiter:stam:2003} examine the relationship between democracy, dictatorship and the initiation of militarized disputes.  They use directed dyads and find that dyads involving a democratic leader on the one hand and a personalist dictator on the other tend to be violent. They also discover that dictators are likely to challenge democracies, but that this is not reciprocal.  In addition, military regimes and single-party regimes are more prone to initiate disputes with democracies, than the other way around.  They use the MID data, but note that ``We code a state as having initiated a dispute if it is on `side A' of a MID, the conventional approach to coding initiation. This means that the state was on the side that took the first action in the dispute, whether that action was the threat, display, or use of force. We code joiners as initiators or targets, though the results do not change if we do not code joiners as initiators or targets. \ldots Though coding initiation will always be difficult, the `side A' variable has been widely used in past conflict scholarship (page 334).'' Independent variables are largely taken from an earlier study and focus on various encodings of regime types, contiguity, alliance, and capability measures. As is prevalent in these kinds of studies, Reiter \& Stam employ a logistic regression that includes an indicator of the time since the last dispute as well as three cubic splines. The database for this study is constructed using EUGene \citep{bennett:stam:2000} and comprises approximately three-quarters of a million stacked dyads. Based on their statistical analysis, they conclude that institutional constraints affect the propensity of democratic and non-democratic leaders to engage in military conflict. 

In the original model, the variable ``Pers/Democ Directed Dyad" (which represents a Personalist $\rightarrow$ Democractic directed dyad) is clearly positive while the variable ``Democ/Personalist Directed Dyad'' is zero and the difference between the two coefficients is clearly distinct from zero. In our re-estimation using the AME framework, we also find that Pers-Democ directed dyad has a positive effect with zero excluded from the 95\% confidence interval while Democ-Pers directed dyad is indistinguishable from zero. Using this model, however, we can no longer conclusively say that the Pers/Democratic coefficient is larger than the Democ/Personalist one. Our re-estimation using the AME approach therefore cast some doubt on Reiter \& Stam's key claim that MIDs initiated by personalist dictatorships against democracies are more likely than MIDS initiated by democracies. Further, the effect of most of the covariates in the literature thought to predict interstate MIDs are much closer to zero when using the AME framework. Finally, our modeling approach outperforms the original model by better, and more accurately, predicting MIDs out-of-sample (Figure~\ref{fig:reitaucpr}).

\subsection{Replication of McDonald (2004)}

\citet{mcdonald:2004} studies whether trade promotes peace between nations. The link between conflict and trade is perplexing, with many persistent, yet competing explanations. \citet{mcdonald:2004} includes the argument that interdependence between states ``makes conflict less likely because of its efficiency over conquest in acquiring resources\ldots (547)''. Accordingly, his primary contribution is to provide evidence challenging the generalized linkage between peace and trade and to offer a new measurement of the key independent variable, trade. \citet{mcdonald:2004} refines the trade variable, arguing that \textit{free} trade, rather than trade alone, reduces the likelihood of conflict between states. His key hypothesis that greater levels of protection increase the probability of interstate conflict, an argument that builds on the work of classic liberalism and connects free trade to the power of domestic audiences. \citet{mcdonald:2004} measures free trade in two ways. The first captures the idea that larger protected sectors generate greater societal pressures resulting in pockets of support for war. This protection variable measures the proportion of customs revenue divided by total imports in the state that possesses the greater such ratio in each dyad. This measure captures the score of the state in the dyad that possesses higher barriers to trade (560). \citet{mcdonald:2004} also includes a measure of economic integration  calculated as ``the lower proportion of total dyadic trade (imports plus exports) divided by state $i$'s GDP or total dyadic trade divided by state $j$'s GDP'' (560). The binary, dependent variable is the onset of a new militarized interstate dispute within a given dyad. \citet{mcdonald:2004} employs logistic regression to examine the putative statistical significance of these variables. The models include splines to correct for temporal dependence, and robust standard errors clustered on each dyad.

% TO DO: include discussion and analysis of different K's in appendix (for M cD)

Our re-estimation with AME reveals that trade relations are highly interdependent and exhibit important patterns of transitivity.  Or, in other words, if countries $i$ and $j$ are highly dependent and countries $j$ and $k$ are also highly dependent, then we are likely to observe high dependency between countries $i$ and $k$. Our findings support those of Traag and Lupu (2013) which argue that indirect trade relations reduce the probability of conflict. This indicates that conflict is less likely between members of a trade community. Once we control for these dependencies, we can more clearly interpret the positive link between trade and conflict.  The most striking thing is that AME finds a positive conditional association between trade dependence and conflict ($\hat{\beta}= 18.4, \quad \sigma_{\hat{\beta}} = 28.6$), while the comparable numbers for the logistic regression found in the original articles are negative ($\hat{\beta}= -22.2, \quad \sigma_{\hat{\beta}} = 15.2$). At the same time, the AME has ROC and PR curves (shown in the Appendix) that dominate the results found in McDonald (2004).

\subsection{Replication of Rose (2004)}

In 2004, Andrew Rose published a study in the \textit{American Economic Review} \nocite{rose:2004} that proved to be quite controversial in terms of macroeconomic trade theory and in terms of trade policy in a variety of nations. It also provoked a number of responses in the international political economy literature \cite{tomz:etal:2007,ward:etal:2013}.  Rose's basic argument is that despite longstanding arguments made by trade theorists and the World Trade Organization that WTO membership fosters greater cooperation and thereby more trade among its members, the empirics do not bear out such claims. He uses a standard gravity model with dyadic data on bilateral merchandise trade (not services) for $175$ countries over a period of five decades. Estimating this model using OLS within many differing contexts, his conclusion was that: ``An extensive search reveals little evidence that countries joining or belonging to the GATT/WTO have different trade patters from outsiders \ldots (2004, page 98, abstract).''  The data for this study have been widely used in replications by many searching for the missing effects of the WTO -- as well as preferential trade agreements, bilateral investment theories, and other aspects of modern trade theory.  

When we compare the results of Rose's original OLS model to the AME model accounting for network dependencies, the results are generally similar. The main result of the model -- the null effect of membership in the WTO, as represented by the ``One-In" and ``Both-In" variables -- persists in the AME model. However, while in the original model there was a clear positive relationship between Real GDP and Trade, most of this effect vanishes in the AME model. The random effects shown in Figure~\ref{fig:roser} reveal the cause of much of this divergence. Here, the states with the most positive random effects are also states with high GDP, though not necessarily high GDP/capita.\footnote{Note: Qatar exhibits strongly negative random effects.} Thus, the effect of GDP in the original model was, in part, an artifact of first-order dependencies. Most of the other results of the model are constant across each model, though some geographic features, such as islands and landlocked states, have a more clear effect on trade once we account for these network dependencies. When we account for network interdependencies, we observe a markedly lower Root Mean Squared Error out-of-sample -- $3.23$ for the OLS model and $1.77$ for the AME model. While the basic model replicates with the basic result, there are substantial and substantive improvements gleaned from the AME results.

\subsection{Replication of Weeks (2012)}

\citet{weeks:2012} examines the influence of domestic institutions on the initiation of military conflicts by autocratic leaders.  She argues that in some circumstances autocrats are held accountable for their foreign policy decisions. She adds the nuance that autocratic audiences are not homogeneous. When the autocratic regime is nonmilitary, the domestic audience do not favor military actions, but in military autocracies this is not the case. Further she argues that in personalistic regimes without a military or civilian domestic audience, the leaders tend to be more likely to employ military force in their foreign policy.  To study this question, she uses a dyadic design in which the dependent variable is ``whether country A in a directed dyad initiated military conflict against country B during year t'' (page 337).  These data come from the Militarized Interstate Disputes database \citep{maoz:2005}.  One major innovation in her study resides in the nuanced way in which she conceptualized and coded regime type into four types: a) Machine, b) Junta, c) Boss, and d) Strongmen. She also includes a variety of putative control variables focusing on capabilities for both sides of the dyad, alliances, geography, trade dependence, regime instability, and the regime type of ``side B.''  She uses a logistic regression, but follows \citet{beck:etal:1998} and includes splines to capture temporal covariation in the dependent variable along with  fixed, unit effects. The analysis is done for dyads, but is considered to be from the perspective of the actor that initiated the dispute. Her time frame is from 1946-1999.  The basic finding is that a) juntas, bosses, and strongmen are more likely to initiate conflict than machines (and maybe democracies) and that b) machines are no more belligerent than democracies.  These insights are mainly determined by looking at coefficients and their putative significance in Tables 1 and 2 (pages 339--340). She makes the argument that ignoring important nuances between different types of autocracies hinders our understanding of the initiation of military conflict by autocracies. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\caption{\label{fig:weekscirc} Visualization of multiplicative effects for Weeks (2012). Blue represents groups with common sending patterns and red represents groups with common receiving patterns.}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

The re-estimation of \citet{weeks:2012} likely has the sharpest divergence between the General Linear Model results and those of the AME Model. In Weeks's initial models,  she finds that machines are less prone to initiate conflict than the reference category, whereas Juntas, Bosses and Strong-men are more conflict-prone, in line with her theoretical expectations. When we look at the posterior distribution of these coefficients in the AME results, we find that none of these values are distinguishable from zero. We similarly find less pronounced effects for military capabilities. One explanation for this divergence is the AME model's ability to account for third order effects. Inspection of the multiplicative effects in Figure~\ref{fig:weekscirc} reveals a number of clusters of states which exhibit structural equivalence -- in the top right corner we see states like the US, the UK, and Israel who often send conflict to similar targets. In particular, we observe a cluster of ``rogue states,'' who are receivers of conflict, in the top right (Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, North Korea). In the bottom corner we see a cluster of authoritarian senders including Iraq, Russia, Syria, North Korea and China. In general, these clusters have similar governmental types (Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea all fell under the ``boss" category), and similar conflict behavior. So, in the GLM, which ignores these third order dependencies, much of these results might have been attributed to regime type. The AME model, on the other hand, finds that it is more efficient to attribute this behavior to the multiplicative effects. In terms of out-of-sample performance, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:weeksauc}, the AME model performs markedly better than the GLM out of sample, lending credence to the possibility that these third order dependencies cause spurious effects for regime type.

\subsection{Replication of Gibler (2017)}


The replications we have undertaken are all from articles over the past fifteen years.  A more recent example is \citet{gibler:2017} which examines the onset of militarized disputes using capabilities, joint democracy, alliances, and power parity in a undirected dyadic study using logistic regression and dyad clustered standard errors.   In addition to this, Gibler shows that the long-standing relationship between the relative parity of capabilities and initiation of international conflict is almost completely mediated by the initial conditions for the members of the dyad when they joined the international system as sovereign members. This finding calls into question many IR theories about the role of balance in terms of generating international conflict \citep{organski:1958}.

%\end{table}

We re-estimated model 6 from Table 6 (2017, 34). The results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:giberrepl} in order to facilitate explicit comparison.
The results obtained with \texttt{amen} stand in stark contrast to those found with a logistic regression (with dyad clustered, robust standard errors).  Most importantly, the primary variable from the Gibler study, parity of the members of a dyad at the year in which they entered the international system, is shown to be unimportant in the AME results.  Not only is the value of this parameter small, but it has a very large relative standard error -- over a magnitude larger than the parameter itself ($z= 0.038$). In addition, the variable indicating whether both members of the dyad were coded as democracies (joint democracy) follows the same pattern: important and strong in the logistic results, but this disappears once interdependencies are modeled.  As might be expected, the strong geographic clustering in the original study is about one-quarter as strong in the AME estimations. Similarly, rivalry coefficients are about one-third the size in the AME formulation, but a great deal more precisely measured ($z=18.116$). 

We utilized the original and the AME results from Gibler's model 6 in Table 6 to calculate the expected values for one scenario. We focused on the variables measuring rivalry.  We used mean or modal values for all independent variables, except we changed the rivalry variable to indicate that there was a rivalry when the actual data suggest there is none.  The expected values of this scenario are essentially a first difference plot comparing results with the model when estimated in two different ways: Gibler's GLM estimation and our AME approach.  As this Figure~\ref{fig:gibmargeff} illustrates, the AME results differ from the GLM in two distinct ways. First, the expected value of the dependent variable -- the probability of the onset of a militarized interstate dispute, is considerably higher when taking interdependencies into account with the AME model.  These are rare events, so the probabilities are low, but the difference is a factor of $3x$. Thus, you get quite substantially different expected values from these two models.  Second, the GLM model has a standard errors which underestimate the true variability, in part because some of them are assumed to be zero.  This shows up in the narrow density of predicted outcomes for the GLM model, compared to the density seen with the AME. The latter reflects a wider range of potential outcomes, reflecting the incorporation of uncertainty in the AME model.

\begin{figure}
	\caption{THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  \label{fig:gibmargeff}}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gibler_margeff.pdf}
 	\label{fig:gibmargeff}
 \end{figure}

Beyond more informative fixed-effects coefficients, the AME approach also provides information about the interdependencies that were modeled. The assumption of independence among the dyadic data in this study can be strongly rejected. Perhaps most importantly, the main substantive conclusions of the 2017 Gibler study do not seem warranted from the perspective of the results obtained with the \texttt{amen} estimation that explicitly models \first- \second-, and \third-order interdependencies. Not only do the estimated coefficients tell a different story, but the assumptions under which the original results would hold are shown to be violated by the data.

\subsection{Lessons Learned from Re-estimating Five Prominent Studies}

First and foremost, many  findings which emerge from models that do not take interdependencies into account lose their statistical significance when network effects are estimated via AME. This should not be news -- since the finding has long been in the theoretical literature, but given the state of current literature in international relations is still pertinent.  Not only
are coefficients biased in the OLS and logit approaches to the analysis of dyadic data, but they are often imprecisely measured, with inflated standard errors.  This means that significant testing (for better or worse) is compromised when network effects are ignored.

Second, even when the results from the AME estimation conform with those found in an OLS or logistic regression, new insights
emerge from the additional information derived. In particular, there is actual information about the dependencies so that clusters can be identified, and the extent of reciprocity at the dyad level, as well as among senders and receivers.  This kind of information
is absent in standard approaches and add to our ability to explain specific as well as general results.

Third, it is evident that the actual results -- not the estimated coefficents and their covariances -- which are generated by the models differ greatly in expectations.  This implies that policy experimentations with the models, as well as scenario-based simulations and forecasting of GLM models are likely to often give misleading results compared to the AME approach.

Fourth, it is clear that the AME approach dominates the OLS and Logit-based approaches in terms of performance. Not only it is better at correctly identifying cases in which the dependent variable takes a value of $0$ (via the ROC curves and associated statistics), but it also dominates at correctly identifying occurrences of the dependent variable in the data (seen via the PR curves and associated statistics).  In the case of studies
with continuous dependent variables, the AME approach has average error statistics that are about one-half that found in the OLS model. It is rare for studies in this area to provide performance statistics, but at the same time that at least one of the studies is unable to identify a single case in spite of having almost a million observations.

Fifth, it is useful to suggest that a lot of what is \textit{known} about international relations based on studies of dyadic data should be taken with a grain of salt, and awaits a reassessment using methods that do not rely on an assumption that all the dyads are independent and identically distributed.
