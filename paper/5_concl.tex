\section{Conclusion}

It is no longer necessary to assume that the interesting, innate interdependencies in relational data can be ignored. Nor do they have to be approximated with ad hoc, incomplete solutions that purport to control for dependencies by modifying the post-estimation standard errors of the estimated coefficients. Instead, the interdependencies may be addressed directly with additive and multiplicative effects in the context of a generalized linear model that provides more reliable inferences and better out-of-sample predictive performance, along with new substantive insights.
