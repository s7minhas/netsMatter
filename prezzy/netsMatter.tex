  \frametitle{Motivation}

  \vspace{-10mm}
  Relational data consists of 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item - a set of units or nodes
    \item - a set of measurements, $y_{ij}$, specific to pairs of nodes $(i,j)$ 
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Relational data assumptions}

GLM: $y_{ij} \sim \beta^{T} X_{ij} + e_{ij}$

Networks typically show evidence against independence of {$e_{ij} : i \neq j$}

Not accounting for dependence can lead to:

\begin{itemize}
\item biased effects estimation
\item uncalibrated confidence intervals
\item poor predictive performance
\item inaccurate description of network phenomena
\end{itemize}

We've been hearing this concern for decades now:

  Values across a row, say $\{y_{ij},y_{ik},y_{il}\}$, may be more similar to each other than other values in the adjacency matrix because each of these values has a common sender $i$

  \frametitle{Social Relations Model (The ``A'' in AME)}

We use this model to form the additive effects portion of AME (Warner et al. 1979, Li \& Loken 2002, Hoff 2005):

\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
      y_{ij} &= \color{red}{\mu} + \color{red}{e_{ij}} \\
      e_{ij} &= a_{i} + b_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
      \{ (a_{1}, b_{1}), \ldots, (a_{n}, b_{n}) \} &\sim N(0,\Sigma_{ab}) \\ 
      \{ (\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{ji}) : \; i \neq j\} &\sim N(0,\Sigma_{\epsilon}), \text{ where } \\
      \Sigma_{ab} = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{a}^{2} & \sigma_{ab} \\ \sigma_{ab} & \sigma_{b}^2   \end{pmatrix} \;\;\;\;\; &\Sigma_{\epsilon} = \sigma_{\epsilon}^{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item - $\mu$ baseline measure of network activity
\item - $e_{ij}$ residual variation that we will use the SRM to decompose
\end{itemize}

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frame{
  \frametitle{Social Relations Model (The ``A'' in AME)}

\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
      y_{ij} &= \mu + e_{ij} \\
      e_{ij} &= \color{red}{a_{i} + b_{j}} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
      \color{red}{\{ (a_{1}, b_{1}), \ldots, (a_{n}, b_{n}) \}} &\sim N(0,\Sigma_{ab}) \\ 
      \{ (\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{ji}) : \; i \neq j\} &\sim N(0,\Sigma_{\epsilon}), \text{ where } \\
      \Sigma_{ab} = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{a}^{2} & \sigma_{ab} \\ \sigma_{ab} & \sigma_{b}^2   \end{pmatrix} \;\;\;\;\; &\Sigma_{\epsilon} = \sigma_{\epsilon}^{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item - row/sender effect ($a_{i}$) \& column/receiver effect ($b_{j}$)
\item - Modeled jointly to account for correlation in how active an actor is in sending and receiving ties
\end{itemize}

}

  \frametitle{Social Relations Model (The ``A'' in AME)}

\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
      y_{ij} &= \mu + e_{ij} \\
      e_{ij} &= a_{i} + b_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
      \{ (a_{1}, b_{1}), \ldots, (a_{n}, b_{n}) \} &\sim N(0,\color{red}{\Sigma_{ab}}) \\ 
      \{ (\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{ji}) : \; i \neq j\} &\sim N(0,\Sigma_{\epsilon}), \text{ where } \\
      \color{red}{\Sigma_{ab}} = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{a}^{2} & \sigma_{ab} \\ \sigma_{ab} & \sigma_{b}^2   \end{pmatrix} \;\;\;\;\; &\Sigma_{\epsilon} = \sigma_{\epsilon}^{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item - $\sigma_{a}^{2}$ and $\sigma_{b}^{2}$ capture heterogeneity in the row and column means
\item - $\sigma_{ab}$ describes the linear relationship between these two effects (i.e., whether actors who send [receive] a lot of ties also receive [send] a lot of ties)
\end{itemize}

\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item - $\epsilon_{ij}$ captures the within dyad effect
\item - Second-order dependencies are described by $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$
\item - Reciprocity, aka within dyad correlation, represented by $\rho$
\end{itemize}

  \includegraphics[width=.33\textwidth]{stochEquivNet}  
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  To account for these patterns we can build on what we have so far and find an expression for $\gamma$:
  
  \vspace{-5mm}
  \begin{align*}
  \centering
  y_{ij} &\approx \beta^{T} X_{ij} + a_{i} + b_{j} + \gamma(u_{i},v_{j})
  \end{align*}

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Latent Factor Model: The ``M'' in AME}

Each node $i$ has an unknown latent factor:

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{align*}
{\textbf{u}_{i},\textbf{v}_{j}} \in \mathbb{R}^{k} \;\; i,j \in \{1, \ldots, n \} \\
\end{align*}

\vspace{-5mm}
The probability of a tie from $i$ to $j$ depends on their latent factors (Hoff 2008, Hoff 2015, Minhas, Hoff \& Ward 2018):

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{align*}
\begin{aligned}
  \gamma(\textbf{u}_{i}, \textbf{v}_{j}) &= \textbf{u}_{i}^{T} D \textbf{v}_{j} \\
  &= \sum_{k \in K} d_{k} u_{ik} v_{jk} \\
  &D \text{ is a  } K \times K \text{ diagonal matrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

Can account for both stochastic equivalence and homophily

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{AME}

The full AME framework enables us to not only account for the types of dependencies that often arise in dyadic data but also estimate them: 

\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    y_{ij} \;=\; f(\theta_{ij}) &\text{, where } \\
    \theta_{ij} \;=\;& \bm\beta_{d}^{\top} \mathbf{X}_{ij} + \bm\beta_{s}^{\top} \mathbf{X}_{i} + \bm\beta_{r}^{\top} \mathbf{X}_{j} \text{\qquad(Exogenous parameters)} \\
    & + a_{i} + b_{j} + \epsilon_{ij} \text{\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad(SRRM parameters)} \\
    & + \mathbf{u}_{i}^{\top} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{v}_{j}  \text{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;(LFM parameters)} \\ 
  \label{eqn:ame}
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Simulation}

Assume that the true data-generating process for a particular $Y$ is given by:

\vspace{-8mm}
\begin{align}
  y_{i,j} \sim  \mu + \beta x_{i,j} + \gamma w_{i,j} + \epsilon_{i,j}
  \label{eqn:sim}
\end{align}

We compare inference for $\mu$ and $\beta$---the latter parameter would be of primary concern for applied scholars---using three models:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the ``standard'' international relations approach estimated through a typical generalized linear model; 
  \item the AME approach outlined in the previous section with a unidimensional latent factor space ($K=1$);
  \item and an ``oracle'' regression model that assumes we have measured all sources of dependencies and thus includes both $x_{i,j}$ and $w_{i,j}$. 
\end{itemize}

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Bias Comparison}

We first compare the performance of the models in terms of how well they estimate the true values of $\mu$ and $\beta$:

}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{Coverage Comparison}

Next, we estimate the 95\% confidence interval for the three models in each of the simulations and estimate the proportion of times that the true value fell within those intervals:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
  \frametitle{What about the missing variable?}

Unobserved dependencies should be captured through the multiplicative effects portion of the model, $\mathbf{U}^{\top} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}$:
