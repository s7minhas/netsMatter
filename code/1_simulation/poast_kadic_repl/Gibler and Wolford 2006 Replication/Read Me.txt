This folder provides STATA do files and data files that accomplishes three tasks:

1) The first folder contains files that replicate the results in Tables 5 through 7 in the paper.

2) The second folder contains files that show how I created the k-adic dataset used to produce the results in tables 5 through 7.

3) The third folder contains files that generate a panel k-adic dataset using the G&W data.  Results from this data are not presented in the paper, but the results are similar to those produced in the paper.

Additionally, this folder contains a document that provides further description of the Gibler and Wolford data.

Note: After you open each do file, you will have to replace the current directory file path with the file path that corresponds to your computer.
