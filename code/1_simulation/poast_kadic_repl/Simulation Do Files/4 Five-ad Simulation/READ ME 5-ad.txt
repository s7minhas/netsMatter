Notes Regarding the Five-ad simulation:

This is a very large simulation that is broken into several parts.  I will now describe each part

- 1 Sim432ads
This do file creates the dyads, triads, and 4-ads for the dataset

- 5ad-v3
This do file uses the data created in the first do file to create 9 partitions of a larger 5-ad dataset.

- Complete5ad
This do file combines together the 9 partitions into a complete 5-ad data set.

- kad_cap
This do file incorporates capability data (created in Sim432ads and stored in the dataset called "practice") into the 5-ad dataset

- kad_region
This do file identifies which region each k-ad member belongs and determines if the members of the k-ad are part of the same region

- kad-estimate
Performs simultaneously the estimation of the full Five-adic dataset and the 5-adic dataset broken into dyads.  This takes awhile!



Because this is a simulation, no datasets are required (all of the required data is created by the dofiles).  However, the size of the created datasets is quite large.  In order to run these simulations, I uploaded the files to a university server and then allocated nearly 8 GB of ram to STATA.  The estimation portion takes approximately 2 weeks to run through the 500 iterations.
