Notes on the Weeks 2012 replication.

DV unit: dyad-year, using dyadic MID data from Maoz (2005).

Cryptic Variables:
s_wt_glo: weighted global s-score; picks up similarity of alliance
portfolios.

s_lead: similarity of state's alliance portfolio with system leader

contig: dummy for contiguity (or less than 24 miles of separation)

logdist: log of distance between capitals


II. Replication file:
"." is the internal STAT marker of missing data, so the syntax of "if
[variable] !=." like subsetting.

The * ending on the "pcyrsmzinits*" variable in the logit call is
STATA synatx for "all variables that start with pcyrsmzinits. Which
means: pcyrsmzinits1, pcyrsmzinits2, pcyrsmzinits3.


III. Replication itself.

** Documentation of issue with missing data and clustered standard errors

-  NOTE: Results occur with a version of the data that subsets on
   whether “democracy_1” is not NA; NOT whether all missing
   observations are removed. If all missing observations are removed,
   even in a version of the data that is subsetted to only have the
   variables used in the regression, the estimated coefficient results
   are different. Also, the number of observations drops
   dramatically. 

What is weird though is that without removing NA values, clustering
the standard errors crashes. Removing the NA values dramatically
changes the number of recorded observations.  

Next step (12/9): run the .do file in STATA and see what the output
is. Did so, her calls report the same N as the paper, for table
1.2. Ran statas's "gen byte used=e(sample)" command, which should
provide a record of which observations were used in the regression.
From there, saved to desktop (saving to Dropbox fails, will move over
by hand).
